                <p>Roshan is a formidable neutral creature located in the pit near the center of the map. Teams often work together to defeat Roshan, as he drops the Aegis of the Immortal upon death. The Aegis grants its holder a second life, allowing them to respawn immediately with full health and mana after being killed in combat.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The hard carry is a hero who requires a significant amount of farm and experience to become powerful in the late game. They excel at dealing high amounts of damage and carrying the team to victory in the later stages of the game. Hard carries are often positioned in the safe lane (bottom for Radiant, top for Dire) where they can farm safely and receive support from a lane partner.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The mid lane hero is responsible for controlling the middle lane and gaining early levels and gold. Mid laners often possess strong abilities and benefit from experience and gold to dominate the game's mid-game phase. They are expected to gank other lanes, secure power runes, and exert map control. Mid lane heroes tend to be versatile and capable of impacting the game's tempo.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The offlane hero, also known as the "offlaner" or "solo laner," is tasked with holding their own in a challenging lane against the enemy carry and support. Offlaners are typically durable heroes who can survive harassment and gain experience even when outnumbered. Their role is to disrupt the enemy's farm, soak up experience, and create space for their team through aggressive plays and strategic positioning.</p>

            <div class="roleLane">

                </div>
                <p>Soft supports, also known as "position 4 supports," have more flexibility in terms of itemization and playstyle. They may roam the map, initiate fights, and secure key objectives like runes and early kills. Soft supports can transition into core roles later in the game if they acquire sufficient resources.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The hard support focuses on securing vision, protecting their team's core heroes, and making sacrifices to ensure their team's success. They often have limited resources and prioritize buying support items like wards, smoke of deceit, and detection.</p>
