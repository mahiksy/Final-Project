                    <div class="overflow" tabindex="0">
                    <p>Born in a temperate realm, raised with her fiery older
                        sister Lina, Rylai the Crystal Maiden soon found that her
                        innate elemental affinity to ice created trouble for all those
                        around her. Wellsprings and mountain rivers froze in moments if she
                        stopped to rest nearby; ripening crops were bitten by frost, and fruiting
                        orchards turned to mazes of ice and came crashing down, spoiled. When their
                        exasperated parents packed Lina off to the equator, Rylai found herself banished
                        to the cold northern realm of Icewrack, where she was taken in by an Ice Wizard
                        who had carved himself a hermitage at the crown of the Blueheart Glacier. After
                        long study, the wizard pronounced her ready for solitary practice and left her
                        to take his place, descending into the glacier to hibernate for a thousand years.
                        Her mastery of the Frozen Arts has only deepened since that time, and now her skills are unmatched.</p>
